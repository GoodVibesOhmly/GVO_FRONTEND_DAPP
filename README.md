### Issues

Feel free to submit issues and enhancement requests [here](https://github.com/new-order-network/dao-app-frontend/issues).

### Contributing

Please refer to the project's style and contribution guidelines for submitting patches and additions. In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

For creating branches, we prefer to format it this way:
`[ISSUE-TAG]/[ISSUE-NUMBER]-[A-MEANINGFUL-TITLE]`. So for example, we have an issue called "Update README" with a tag of "enhancement" and issue number of 1, the ideal branch name could be: `enhancement/1-update-readme`

**Steps for Contributing with the "fork-and-pull" workflow:**

1.  **Fork** the repo on GitHub
2.  **Clone** the project to your own machine
3.  **Commit** changes to your own branch
4.  **Push** your work back up to your fork
5.  Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes

**NOTE:** Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!
